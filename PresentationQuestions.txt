Shader: Hand drawn shader. Makes everything black and white and makes the shadows crosshatched

How shader works:
Create an image with a depth mapwdw
Create an image with a normal map -> normal * 0.5f + 0.5f

Pass images through a sobel filter that detects if there is a big difference of colour, if there is a big difference it draws a line

Create an image with standard effect. If there is a shadow, keep the colour, if there is not, make it white

Final shader checks if the shadow image is dark or lighter. If darker use the crosshatch texture

Challenges:
Finding out a good calculation of the sobel filter. There is a lot of theoretical stuff but not a lot of actual code online.
Figuring out how I should do the shadows.
Once I figured out how to do something it wasn't that hard to code.

Improvements:
Use a perlin noise map to make lines slightly squiggly to look more hand drawn.
Use less shaders and clean up the code.
Make it so there can also be colour in the image.
Use simpler and multiple crosshatch textures.ds
